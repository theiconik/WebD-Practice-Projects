      <h1>Animals</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        There are so many species of animals in the world. The entire animal
        world may be classified into five types.<br />
        They are amphibians, reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects. The animals
        that live both on land and in water have moist skin and no scales on
        body are called amphibians. The toad and the frog are the two good
        examples of amphibians.<br />

        The animals having cold blood, scaly body and needing to be in the sun
        for a long period of time are called reptiles.<br />

        The two most common examples of reptiles are the snake and the
        crocodile.<br />

        The mammal is an animal that has warm blood and hairy body. It
        breast-feeds its young. The cow, the lion and man are some of the good
        examples of this type.<br />

        Birds have wings, beaks, and can fly. The parrot and the crow are some
        examples of birds.<br />

        Bees and mosquitoes are called insects. The body of an insect has three
        parts – the head, the thorax and the abdomen. It has six legs, but no
        backbone. It can also fly like the bird.<br />
        The Earth is home to many creatures. Animals have been the inhabitants
        of this planet, along with humans. Historically, animals were used for
        transportation, protection, as well as for hunting. Animals have been
        companions to man since time immemorial. Animals are the kingdom while
        classifying their species.<br />
        There are a variety of species present under this, with their presence
        spanning across the world. Amphibians primarily require a moist
        environment as they breathe and absorb through thin skins.<br />
        Some amphibians include frogs, salamanders, toads, and caecilians.
        Mammals are vertebrates and warm-blooded. Females have mammary glands to
        feed their young ones and have a thick coat of fur.<br />
        Mammals include carnivores, bears, rodents, etc. Reptiles are
        vertebrates, but lay eggs. Some of them have scales. Common reptiles are
        lizards, turtles, and snakes.<br />
        Insects have an exoskeleton. They have three pairs of legs, a head,
        thorax, and abdomen. Beetles, ants, and bees are some insects. Birds
        have wings, beaks, and feathers such as eagles, pigeons, crows, and
        sparrows.<br />
        There are many species of animals that are domesticated as well, such as
        dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, etc. Animals are vital to the ecosystem.
        Animals have different purposes when it comes to the environment.<br />
        Even microorganisms help to clean our planet. Many animals aide plants
        to converting free nitrogen present in the air and nourishing the roots
        and a crucial role in sustaining ecological balance.<br />
        Predatory animals keep the population in the animal population
        controlled. Animals that feed on plants help to control plant growth.
        They also provide us with the food required for our survival. Poultry,
        dairy, and meat serve as essentials to many cultures and their diets.<br />
        Animals are one of the oldest companions of humans. However, many
        species face the threat of extinction. Urbanization causes cutting down
        forests to meet the needs of the growing human population. Cutting down
        forests has led to a loss of habitat for many animals.<br />
        Habitat destruction has caused damage to animal life. Lions and bears
        traditionally hunted for their fur, elephants for their ivory tusks, and
        alligators for leather sell in black markets. <br />Torturing animals
        and locking them in cages affects their wellbeing. Dumping effluents
        into water bodies affect marine life. Global warming also affects
        animals, with dried up water bodies and seasonal changes that have
        consequences on these species. Using animals to test human-made drugs
        has received widespread criticism as the animals suffer irreparable
        damages.<br />
        The importance of conserving animals has been recognized all over the
        world. International organizations such as the PETA and World Wide Fund
        for Nature (WWF) aim to spread awareness on preservation.<br />
        Countries have strict laws for animal conservation. The Indian
        government has many wildlife protection projects such as Project Tiger
        and Project Elephant, animals whose populations are decreasing
        drastically.<br />
        World Wildlife Day is commemorated on the 3rd of March every year. An
        initiative by the United Nations, 2020’s theme is “Sustaining all life
        on Earth” to meet sustainable development goals.<br />
        It is vital to conserve animals as the Earth is there home as much as it
        is ours. The living organisms that are eukaryotes and formed of numerous
        cells and those who sexually reproduce are called animals.<br />
        Animals play a unique role in maintaining the balance of nature. Several
        animal species exist in both land and water, and each has a purpose for
        their existence. <br />The animals are divided into particular groups in
        biology for better understanding of their species like- amphibians (the
        animals that can live on both land and water), reptiles (scaled body and
        cold-blooded animals), mammals (the animals that give birth to the
        offspring in the womb and has mammary glands), <br />birds (forelimbs
        evolved to wings, mostly feather-covered body, and lays eggs for giving
        birth), fishes (has fins in place of limbs, and gills for respiration in
        water), insects (they are mostly six-legged or more, and most have a
        head, thorax, and abdomen), etc.<br />
        Since human beings’ existence and evolution, we have established
        ourselves as the greater and more superior species for our sophisticated
        and more advanced way of thinking and applying. Humans have also learned
        to use animals for their benefit and have realized how to incorporate
        animals into our social lives. <br />Animal husbandry is not a new
        practice done and has been in existence for a very long time. The bond
        between humans and animals has increased, and now both coexist with a
        mutual understanding of nature.<br />
        We have also strived to preserve the near exist and rare species through
        modern modes of conservation like zoological gardens and sanctuaries. We
        have used animals for clothes, food, transportation, and
        entertainment.<br />
        Animals have also been beneficial for us to discover new things from
        research and tests. Several vaccines and medicines are the blessings of
        the resources we obtained from animals.<br />
        Animals have also been a part of outer-space explorations, which has
        achieved milestones in scientific discoveries. Among these activities,
        some were for good reasons and to sustain a livelihood, but some were
        just the act of evil and torture the poor animals. With the
        modernization of the world, people started thinking about animals and
        worked for their rights.<br />
        It is essential to realize that with power, great responsibility comes
        as well. Hence, we should never abuse animals for our benefits.<br />
        As good human beings, we must always revolt against any inhumane
        activity that harms our fellow wild friends.
