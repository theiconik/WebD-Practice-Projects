      <h1>Animals</h1>

      <p>
        There are so many species of animals in the world. The entire animal
        world may be classified into five types.<br />
        They are amphibians, reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects. The animals
        that live both on land and in water have moist skin and no scales on
        body are called amphibians. The toad and the frog are the two good
        examples of amphibians.<br />

        The animals having cold blood, scaly body and needing to be in the sun
        for a long period of time are called reptiles.<br />

        The two most common examples of reptiles are the snake and the
        crocodile.<br />

        The mammal is an animal that has warm blood and hairy body. It
        breast-feeds its young. The cow, the lion and man are some of the good
        examples of this type.<br />

        Birds have wings, beaks, and can fly. The parrot and the crow are some
        examples of birds.<br />

        Bees and mosquitoes are called insects. The body of an insect has three
        parts – the head, the thorax and the abdomen. It has six legs, but no
        backbone. It can also fly like the bird.<br> The Earth is home to many
        creatures. Animals have been the inhabitants of this planet, along with
        humans. Historically, animals were used for transportation, protection,
        as well as for hunting. Animals have been companions to man since time
        immemorial. Animals are the kingdom while classifying their species.<br>
        There are a variety of species present under this, with their presence
        spanning across the world. Amphibians primarily require a moist
        environment as they breathe and absorb through thin skins.<br> Some
        amphibians include frogs, salamanders, toads, and caecilians. Mammals
        are vertebrates and warm-blooded. Females have mammary glands to feed
        their young ones and have a thick coat of fur.<br> Mammals include
        carnivores, bears, rodents, etc. Reptiles are vertebrates, but lay eggs.
        Some of them have scales. Common reptiles are lizards, turtles, and
        snakes.<br> Insects have an exoskeleton. They have three pairs of legs, a
        head, thorax, and abdomen. Beetles, ants, and bees are some insects.
        Birds have wings, beaks, and feathers such as eagles, pigeons, crows,
        and sparrows.<br> There are many species of animals that are domesticated as
        well, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, etc. Animals are vital to the
        ecosystem. Animals have different purposes when it comes to the
        environment.<br> Even microorganisms help to clean our planet. Many animals
        aide plants to converting free nitrogen present in the air and
        nourishing the roots and a crucial role in sustaining ecological
        balance.<br> Predatory animals keep the population in the animal population
        controlled. Animals that feed on plants help to control plant growth.
        They also provide us with the food required for our survival. Poultry,
        dairy, and meat serve as essentials to many cultures and their diets.<br>
        Animals are one of the oldest companions of humans. However, many
        species face the threat of extinction. Urbanization causes cutting down
        forests to meet the needs of the growing human population. Cutting down
        forests has led to a loss of habitat for many animals.<br> Habitat
        destruction has caused damage to animal life. Lions and bears
        traditionally hunted for their fur, elephants for their ivory tusks, and
        alligators for leather sell in black markets. <br>Torturing animals and
        locking them in cages affects their wellbeing. Dumping effluents into
        water bodies affect marine life. Global warming also affects animals,
        with dried up water bodies and seasonal changes that have consequences
        on these species. Using animals to test human-made drugs has received
        widespread criticism as the animals suffer irreparable damages.<br> The
        importance of conserving animals has been recognized all over the world.
        International organizations such as the PETA and World Wide Fund for
        Nature (WWF) aim to spread awareness on preservation.<br> Countries have
        strict laws for animal conservation. The Indian government has many
        wildlife protection projects such as Project Tiger and Project Elephant,
        animals whose populations are decreasing drastically.<br> World Wildlife Day
        is commemorated on the 3rd of March every year. An initiative by the
        United Nations, 2020’s theme is “Sustaining all life on Earth” to meet
        sustainable development goals.<br> It is vital to conserve animals as the
        Earth is there home as much as it is ours.
