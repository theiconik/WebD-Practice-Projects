# WebD-Practice-Projects

<h2>1. Wander</h2>
This project is simply a template for the homepage of a travel website and the great thing about this project is it looks pretty dope since there's an aerial footage of a seashore playing in the background.

<h2>2. AnimBar</h2>
A super cool looking navigation sidebar using HTML, CSS (Sass) and also using Sass module implementation. So in case you only need, sidebar CSS code there's a Sass module for it named as "_animbar.scss".
