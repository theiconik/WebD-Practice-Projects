# WebD-Practice-Projects

<h2>1. Wander</h2>
This project is simply a template for the homepage of a travel website and the great thing about this project is it looks pretty dope since there's an aerial footage of a seashore playing in the background.

<h2>2. AnimBar</h2>
A super cool looking navigation sidebar using HTML, CSS (Sass) and also using Sass module implementation. So in case you only need, sidebar CSS code there's a Sass module for it named as "_animbar.scss".

<h2>2. Sai-inUp</h2>
A Sassy looking SignIn/SignUp page made using mostly Sass (ofcourse, HTML) and a very little bit of JavaScript. Basically the difficult part is to create the layout of this project and understanding the logic behind the animation. Here's how it looks!

<h2>3. Starbucks-CoffeeTime</h2>
A clean and awesome aesthetic landing page for Starbucks. Also this project is responsive, and yes you know what, Starbucks was coming to my city (Kanpur) while i was making this page, so I mailed them that you can use my design to kind off message out the people of Kanpur, that you have finally got setup in the city! Just kidding, I didn't do that!

<h2>4. Nike-Hover</h2>
Basically, a very very minimal website but pretty cool card animation which can be used for giving details about a product, when hovered over it as I have done. So, as the name suggests the product name is Hover (Studs) by Nike.

<h2>5. GameZon</h2>
So, Glassomorphism UI was quite trending, so @developedbyed came up with this project tutorial and yeah, I really liked this trend and watching his tutorial created (and tweaked a little bit part) this mini web project which I guess looks supercool!

<h2>6. PfGlass</h2>
PfGlass, short name for Portfolio Glass! So name says it all! Continuing one more project on Glassomorphism UI, I made a card with my basic intro and added cool animations like moving gradient background and vanilla-tilt. So this mini project is kind animation oriented.

<h2>6. Heaven</h2>
So basically, I saw the small clip of moving clouds and beautiful background and thought of making it! Seemed difficult on the clip, but as I started doing it was pretty easy!

<h2> 8. INDIANFlag</h2>
As the name says, it's basically my country, INDIA's flag. So it was our Republic Day, so I was kind of checking out GSap and tried to make this pretty cool intro animation of the Indian flag on the website.
